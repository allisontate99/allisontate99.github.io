title: Week 10

It is the tenth and final week of internship, and I am writing this on my last day of this program. It feels like yesterday when I was starting the internship back in May, but now I am leaving the program with new knowledge and experience to help me in my future career. The program also got me very interested in the computer field that I decided to go back to university after graduation to finish my degree in either cybersecurity or information technology. I am proud of the final presentation my partner and I gave out yesterday since it felt like ten weeks of hard work and effort into one presentation. It is a significant accomplishment since I never gave a lengthy presentation in the past. I also feel like I made a contribution to the field of accessible technology with what we found in our research/study. I did not think that I would meet the app developer, but I did, which was an exciting experience. Overall, I am happy I took on this internship since I learned so much from this program.
