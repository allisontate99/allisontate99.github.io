title: Week 8
---

The eighth week of the internship was chaotic for both work and personal life for me. Last week, my father suffered a medical emergency, and we weren’t sure if he would be okay or not. Thankfully, he came home on Tuesday, but I had to assist him with a lot of things while keeping the household clean and organized. I was also dealing with recording data and writing up slides for the next week’s presentation. Luckily, my partner was understanding of my family situation, but I still did my best to help him when he needed it. The studies went well without any issues, but we did note issues that arise with a particular browser and how the lightning can affect results. I feel like I am learning so much from the application since several factors can affect the results. I cannot believe there are only two weeks left in this internship since it feels like yesterday I was only starting my first day. Time flies when you are busy with work and personal life.
