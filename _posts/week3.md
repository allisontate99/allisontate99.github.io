The third week of the internship started with me editing Literature Review and finishing up the slides for the presentation. The literature review ended up being thirty-four pages long which amaze me as I have never written such a long document like that in my life! I am so glad that an application like Grammarly exists so I can edit all of the grammar and spelling mistakes to make our document look much nicer. I also took time to practice my signing for the presentation since we aimed to keep it under 10 minutes. My partner and I split up the slides between us so we can present equally to the program meeting. I paid attention to others’ presentations, and I learn so much more about accessible technology and all the current research on their respective topics. I knew there was research into accessible technology, but I honestly didn’t think it was extensive. I wonder how the methodology and testing portions of the project will go since I do not have prior experience with doing studies or dealing with participants. It will be a new learning experience for me.
