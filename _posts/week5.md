title: Week 5
---

This week has been short and quiet as we started to conducted a pilot study to work out any issues that might arise during the experimentation phase. My partner explained the demo and study to our first two participants while I input the testing result into our spreadsheet. I get to watch and learn how the application works in real-time, which greatly enriched my knowledge of the process and technology in general. We have had two participants so far, but we can recruit our family and friends to participate in the study. I thought my mother would be a great participant as she is hard of hearing and can sign in ASL with me. She prefers to speak English but will still communicate with me in sign language. Regardless, I know next week will be all about testing and inputting results into the spreadsheet. I am just glad this phase is much easier since the literature review was challenging at some times. I was surprised to find out that we will have a day off on June 18th thanks to a newly created federal holiday called Juneteenth. I was honestly expecting to do more work that day, but I will take advantage of visiting my family over the weekend.
