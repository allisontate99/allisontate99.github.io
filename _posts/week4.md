title: Week 4

The fourth week of the internship was focused on testing and methodology. I will admit that testing and methodology is not my strongest skill, but I was focused on creating forms for participants to fill out after participating in the study. I am very much into writing and creating forms side of the project, which my partner was completely fine with it. I managed to finish writing the background and methodology sections for the final report this week, which means less work for us to do later in the project. This is the most manageable week since we are done with the literature review, which was a time-consuming task since it requires me to read articles and write summaries before organizing them in one paper. It was not easy proofreading and making sure it flows since it was about thirty-four pages long. This week was much easier since I only needed to create some forms and write two sections for the final paper. I am looking forward to next week when we started testing with participants so we can gather data, so I believe it will be another easy week for me.
