The second internship was focused on finishing Literature Review. My partner and I discussed dividing up the tasks among ourselves. He will do computer and coding related while I do the writing and creating presentations. During this time, I have been learning how to balance work, academics, and family, which can be challenging, but I am finally got it handled. I am doing chores and errands for my family since they are working, and I am the only one at home. I am also working on my Honors capstone project, so I am constantly making sure I am meeting the deadlines from my committee while doing this internship as well. It is much easier to manage now, but I have been growing a little nervous about next weekâ€™s presentation during the program meeting since I am not much of a public speaker. I do not enjoy talking in front of crowds, but I must do it if I want to lessen my anxiety in front of crowds. I will practice the presentation next week once we finish it so I can feel a little more prepared for the actual presentation.
