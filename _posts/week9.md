title: Week 9
---

The ninth week of the internship was pretty busy with scheduled studies, data gathering, and getting everything ready for the final report and presentation next week. I cannot believe the internship is nearly over since I did not notice those weeks going by so quickly. I became much more confident in doing the studies that I always managed to finish in 30 minutes. Data gathering was fun activity for me as I felt like I was learning more about the application and trying to form my conclusions based on the data. Of course, the conclusion kept changing with every participant, but it was a great learning experience for me. As of now, I am still trying to recruit few more family members to participate in the study so my partner and I can meet our goal of having 20 people for the study. We are going to finish the paper and presentation next week. We met with the application developer today, and it was interesting to hear his thoughts on our data and the problems with the application. This internship taught me many things, including balancing the work/family life, and it was more noticeable when my father had a medical crisis a few weeks ago. However, I am looking forward to next week and finishing up everything because it was a great experience.
