title: Week 7

The seventh week of the internship was very slow and quiet since we started the week waiting for approval from IRB so we can begin the actual study. I feel very prepared to start the study with my partner, but we did not get IRB approval until Wednesday night. We decided we would start the study with participants after the break. We spent this week reaching out to people we know and scheduling the study with them. I watched the other groupâ€™s presentation on the progression of their study, and they gave me some great ideas for the study, such as tracking the participants if they finished the study and got paid for it. I feel like we would be much more organized to keep track of how many studies we did so far. I am glad we have a break next week, so I will take advantage of that time to focus on my capstone project, spending time with my family, and, most importantly, relaxing with my favorite hobbies. After the break, I will be finishing the study with my partner before I finish writing the final research paper and poster for this project. I am looking forward to doing all of that after the break.
