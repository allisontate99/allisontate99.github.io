My first week of internship was exciting and informative since I learned many things about sign language detection, which I am working with Shane Angel. I attended the orientation on the first day, where I learned my duties, expectations and introduced myself to other people in the group. My partner created a server where we can focus on the research together and sharing sources. We also divided tasks among ourselves, and it helps that we got a jump start due to this topic already being in my partnerâ€™s Honors capstone project. I have been learning a lot about the topic. While I do not know much about coding/programming, I do have enough knowledge about computer terminology to understand what the articles describe the process to me. I am looking forward to next week to learn more and finish up the research portion of the project.
