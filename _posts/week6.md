title: Week 6

The sixth week of the internship started off busy, with us finishing three more pilot studies and improving our methods each time. I was proud of myself for finishing the presentation without making too many mistakes with signing since public speaking is not my strongest suit. I listened to other groupsâ€™ presentations on their methodology, and it was interesting to see how they will conduct their studies. We will be recruiting participants since we got approval from IRB. We are hoping we can get all the testing done before the 4th of July break. My partner and I planned out the remaining portions of the project, so we hope to finish early. The project was pretty stressful at the beginning since there was so much to do, but now it feels more manageable and productive since we are finishing up a lot of work every day, and I get a sense of satisfaction at the end of the day. I know next week will be busy with recruiting and testing with participants, so I hope to keep up with the pace we are at for next week.
